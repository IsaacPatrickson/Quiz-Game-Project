My A-level NEA Project code

FOR THIS PROJECT TO FUNCTION ON YOUR OWN MACHINE PLEASE READ AND EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS!

1. Install mySQL on your machine
2. Create a new database
3. Navigate to "SQL Text Files" within the repo
4. Run "DataBase_relationships_for_my_project.sql" in your mySQL window
5. All your tables should be good to go
6. Your machine is ready to run the code. Have fun messing around with it.

DISCLAIMER: This project is in no way fine tuned or the most visually pleasing. Due to time constraints, this is the best I could make. Many improvements can be made and I encourage you to do so.
