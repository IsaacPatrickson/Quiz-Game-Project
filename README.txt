My A-level NEA Project code

FOR THIS PROJECT TO FUNCTION ON YOUR OWN MACHINE PLEASE READ AND EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS!

1. Install mySQL on your machine
2. Create a new database
3. Navigate to "SQL Text Files" within the repo
4. Open the "Database Relationship File"
5. Copy the SQL commands within that file and paste them into mySQL

DISCLAIMER: This project is in no way fine tuned or the most visually pleasing. Due to time constraints, this is the best I could make. Many improvements can be made and I encourage you to do so.
